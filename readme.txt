Relation for Excel

This macro provides functions to make simple relational algebra
The relational model is simplified. A relation is defined as a 2d-table, columns have neither name nor type and are adressed by position (1-based)
However, rows are not ordered (except with relOrder function) and do not have duplicates

Unlike other Excel solutions, this one is purely functional, not using macros.
Relations are saved as text in one cell with :: als field and newline as row separator

Note that in a cell, the text cannot be more than 32k characters.
